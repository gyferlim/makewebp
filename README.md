Replace all common image format inside of a folder with webp format without changing filename or extension (exact replacement)

Usage:  makewebp <folder_path>
Usage Example: ./makewebp img 
it will replace all file with image extension {jpg,jpeg,png,tiff,bmp,gif,JPG,JPEG,PNG,TIFF,BMP,GIF} with webp format
but filename and extension remain the same ( direct replacement )

if ./makewebp doesn't work,  try "chmod +x makewebp" so makewebp is executable.
